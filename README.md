# Healthcare_analysis_using_SQL
This project analyzes a healthcare dataset using SQL queries to uncover insights into population health, chronic diseases, lifestyle habits, preventive care, and high-risk groups.   The goal is to demonstrate how structured query analysis can generate meaningful findings that support public health decisions.

# üè• Healthcare Data Analysis with SQL (PostgreSQL)

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes a healthcare dataset using **PostgreSQL** queries to uncover insights into **population health, chronic diseases, lifestyle habits, preventive care, and high-risk groups**.  
The goal is to demonstrate how structured query analysis can generate meaningful findings that support public health decisions.

## üîç Analysis Roadmap

### Demographics & General Health



```sql
1. Population by state and sex  
- Distribution of general health status  
- Average physical and mental health days  

SELECT State, Sex, COUNT(*) AS population
FROM health_dataset
GROUP BY State, Sex
ORDER BY population DESC;

```
2. Lifestyle & Health Correlations
Impact of physical activity on physical health
Sleep hours vs mental health days
Smoking status vs heart attack prevalence

sql
SELECT "Sleep Hours", AVG("Mental Health Days") AS avg_mental
FROM health_dataset
GROUP BY "Sleep Hours"
ORDER BY "Sleep Hours";
```

```
3. Chronic Disease Insights
- Smoking status vs heart attack prevalence
- Multi-condition cases (patients with both diabetes & heart disease)

sql
SELECT "smokerstatus",
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN "hadheartattack"='Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT(*),2) AS heart_attack_pct
FROM health_dataset
GROUP BY "smokerstatus";
```

```
4. Preventive Care
BMI categories vs diabetes risk

sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN "bmi" < 18.5 THEN 'Underweight'
        WHEN "bmi" >= 18.5 AND "bmi" <= 24.9 THEN 'Normal'
        WHEN "bmi" >= 25   AND "bmi" <= 29.9 THEN 'Overweight'
        ELSE 'Obese'
    END AS bmi_category,

ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN "haddiabetes" = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*),2) AS Percent_diabetes

FROM health_dataset
GROUP BY bmi_category
ORDER BY Percent_diabetes DESC;
```
